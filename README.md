----------------------------------------

 - **Traveling in square trouble:**:black_square_button:
 
     The robot goes in a square shape, ie that goes at equal distances for example the distance that went to the right will be the same distance that           progresses forward so that it shows his ability to walk in any shape we want we chose a square

----------------------------------------

 - **Traveled by a number of applause:**:clap:
  
      The robot moves according to the number of applause, if you clap twice it goes forward, if you clap twice again then it goes back, twice more it goes right and twice more it goes left The third time he is applauded he stops

 -  - ----------------------------------------

 - **Identifies a person and shoots him**:dog:
 
    It's like a watchdog he goes around in every possible direction so he has the ability to look for a human, if he recognizes a human then he shoots him,
from what we see in the video the robot goes natural in all directions while recognizing a human so he input that there is a human and shot at him in addition to that we added a shot

 -  - ----------------------------------------
 - **Shoots in the direction of the blow**:punch:

The robot shoots in the direction of the one who gives it a blow, if you give it a blow from the right side then it turns to the right and then shoots likewise to the left side

 -  - ----------------------------------------
 - **The robot recognizes numbers and shoots numbers in ascending order:**:dart:

The robot searches for the numbers so that it goes in the order of the numbers (you can set as many numbers as you want), we chose that the robot recognizes the mark of the numbers 1,2,3 at first the robot looks for the number 1 and shoots it and then continues to search for the consistent number of 1 which is 2 Another number or some other sign he ignores and continues to look for the next consistent number
