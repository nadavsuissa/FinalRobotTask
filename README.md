 _Explanation of ROBOMASTER S1:_
----------------------------------------

It mediates between the digital world and the real world and brings to life abstract theories through practical actions so that it can identify up to 44 markers, is able to identify and track any individual you select, gestures and applause to expand the possibilities for coding, fighting and learning


:pushpin:_The actions of the robot:_
----------------------------------------

             Changes the color of the lights(LightsandLeds.py)
             Traveling in square trouble(DriveFunctionality.py)
             (BlasterFunctionality.py)
             Traveled by a number of applause(Cllaps.py)
             (BlasterIdentify.py)
             :dog:(WatchDog.py)
             Shoots in the direction of the blow(HitDetection.py)
             The robot recognizes numbers and shoots numbers in ascending order (DriveandIdentify.py)


----------------------------------------


_Detailed explanation of each action:_
----------------------------------------

 - **Changes the color of the lights:**:rainbow:
  
     The robot changes its colors
  
----------------------------------------

 - **Traveling in square trouble:**:black_square_button:
 
     The robot goes in a square shape, ie that goes at equal distances for example the distance that went to the right will be the same distance that           progresses forward so that it shows his ability to walk in any shape we want we chose a square
----------------------------------------


 - **Changes the color of the lights:**
 - ----------------------------------------

 - **Traveled by a number of applause:**:clap:
  
      The robot moves according to the number of applause, if you clap twice it goes forward, if you clap twice again then it goes back, twice more it goes right and twice more it goes left
 -  - ----------------------------------------

 - **Shoots in the direction of the blow**:punch:






 -  - ----------------------------------------
 - **The robot recognizes numbers and shoots numbers in ascending order:**:dart:

The robot searches for the numbers so that it goes in the order of the numbers (you can set as many numbers as you want), we chose that the robot recognizes the mark of the numbers 1,2,3 at first the robot looks for the number 1 and shoots it and then continues to search for the consistent number of 1 which is 2 Another number or some other sign he ignores and continues to look for the next consistent number
